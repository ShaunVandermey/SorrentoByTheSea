# SorrentoByTheSea
A student project showcasing my HTML and CSS knowledge.

A website made to client specifications including styles, structure, and included features. The HTML and CSS was written completely from the ground-up, without use of additional libraries or tools. The websiteâ€™s purpose is to provide a platform for marketing and customer bookings. The website also features an integrated, interactable map provided by Google Maps and an easy-to-navigate structure.

Currently the project does not include any JavaScript/backend language for more powerful options regarding website dynamics, booking submissions, or search functions. Due to the student project nature of the website, it is also not suitable for viewing on mobile, and is not hosted online.
